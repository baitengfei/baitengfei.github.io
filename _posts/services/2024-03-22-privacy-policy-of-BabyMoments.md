Welcome to [BabyMoments] . The App is designed to document your baby's life logs. This Privacy Policy aims to transparently explain how we handle information generated while you use the App, including how we collect, use, and protect your information, and your rights regarding this information.

## 1. Information Collection and Purpose

### Information We Do Not Collect: 
The App does not require user login, nor does it request any permissions from the user, including but not limited to location, contacts, or media access permissions. Therefore, we do not collect any information that can directly identify users, such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
### Data Sharing and Synchronization: 
The App offers a data sharing and synchronization service based on Apple’s official CloudKit feature, aimed at helping users share and synchronize their baby's growth records with family and friends. Through this feature, users can invite others to view and edit specific data. Please note that this process is fully supported by Apple's CloudKit service, and we do not directly access or store any data shared through CloudKit. Consequently, the handling of this data is governed by Apple’s privacy policy.
## 2. Data Storage and Security

We do not store any personally identifiable information on our servers. All data shared through CloudKit is stored on Apple's servers, adhering to Apple’s data security standards and privacy policies.

## 3. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and, where possible, we will notify you through the App or via the email address you have provided. We will provide clear notice before the changes take effect. We encourage you to review this privacy policy regularly to understand how we protect your information.
